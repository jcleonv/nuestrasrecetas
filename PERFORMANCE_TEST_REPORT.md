✅ **Query Optimization:**
- Database functions for complex operations (`create_recipe_version`)
- Recursive CTEs for fork tree traversal
- Efficient pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
- JSON aggregation for related data

#### **Identified Performance Strengths**
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Properly implemented without performance impact
- **Trigger Functions:** Efficient update propagation
- **Data Types:** Appropriate use of UUID, JSONB, and specialized types
- **Constraints:** Prevent data inconsistency without overhead

## 4. Security Verification Results

### Security Score: ✅ EXCELLENT (9.5/10)

#### **Input Validation & Sanitization**
✅ **Comprehensive Input Sanitization:**
```python
def sanitize_input(text: str, max_length: int = 500) -> str:
    sanitized = html.escape(text.strip())  # XSS Prevention
    return sanitized[:max_length]  # Length limiting
```

✅ **Validation Patterns:**
- Regex validation for usernames: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`
- Email format validation
- Length restrictions on all user inputs
- Type checking and bounds validation

#### **XSS Prevention** ✅ GOOD (with recommendations)
- **Backend:** Proper `html.escape()` usage
- **Frontend:** ⚠️ Multiple `innerHTML` usages identified (28 instances)
  - **Risk Level:** Medium - Content is primarily static/trusted
  - **Recommendation:** Replace with safer DOM methods

#### **SQL Injection Prevention** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Parameterized queries via Supabase client
- No direct SQL concatenation found
- Prepared statements in database functions

#### **Authentication & Authorization** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Supabase Auth integration with JWT tokens
- Row Level Security policies properly implemented
- Session management with secure token storage
- Proper user context validation

#### **CORS Configuration** ✅ GOOD
```python
allowed_origins = [
    "https://nuestrasrecetas.club",
    "https://www.nuestrasrecetas.club"
]
```
- Restrictive CORS policy for production
- Development origins conditionally added

**No critical production-blocking issues identified.**

### Medium Priority Issues: 2

#### **Security Enhancement Needed**
**Issue:** Multiple `innerHTML` usages in frontend templates (28 instances)
**Risk:** Potential XSS if user content is ever directly rendered
**Fix:** Replace with safer DOM manipulation:
```javascript
// Instead of: element.innerHTML = userContent;
// Use: element.textContent = userContent;
// Or: element.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', sanitizedContent);
```

#### **Performance Optimization Opportunity**
**Issue:** Recipe version history could become slow with large version counts
**Fix:** Implement version pagination and lazy loading for version diffs

### Low Priority Issues: 1
