- Performance rating: Good

## Key Findings

### ✅ Working Features:
1. **Core Infrastructure:** Server, database, and Supabase integration are fully operational
2. **Main Pages:** Home, Community, Profile, and Groups pages are accessible
3. **Authentication:** Protected endpoints correctly require authentication
4. **Performance:** Excellent response times across all endpoints

### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **Missing Routes:** `/activity` and `/recipes` return 404 errors
2. **API Access:** `/api/recipes` requires authentication but should be public
3. **Missing Endpoints:** `/api/activity` and `/api/user/preferences` not implemented

## Recommendations

### Critical (Fix Immediately):
1. **Implement missing routes:** Add `/activity` and `/recipes` routes in Flask app
2. **Fix API authentication:** Make `/api/recipes` publicly accessible
3. **Add missing API endpoints:** Implement `/api/activity` and `/api/user/preferences`

### High Priority:
1. **Route validation:** Review all routes defined in the app against test expectations
2. **API documentation:** Document which endpoints require authentication
3. **Error handling:** Ensure 404 pages return proper error messages

### Medium Priority:
1. **Test coverage:** Add tests for authenticated API calls
2. **Integration tests:** Test full user workflows (registration, recipe creation, etc.)
3. **Frontend JavaScript:** Test interactive features and AJAX calls

## Test Execution Details

- **Total Tests Run:** 13
- **Passed:** 8
- **Failed:** 5
- **Success Rate:** 61.54%
- **Execution Time:** < 1 second
- **Test Data Saved:** `test_results_20250804_003305.json`

## Conclusion

The NuestrasRecetas application has a solid foundation with working core features. The main issues are missing routes and incorrect authentication settings on some API endpoints. With the recommended fixes implemented, the application should achieve a 100% test pass rate.

The excellent performance metrics and stable infrastructure indicate the app is ready for production use once the routing issues are resolved.
